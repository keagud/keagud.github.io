     Imagine you want to plant a brand new vegetable garden somewhere in your yard, and the first task is to stake out the plot. Odds are good that you'll be perfectly successful by just eyeballing it, hammering a wooden stake at one corner, and using it as a reference. Or you could be more formal and use a tape measure. The ultimate, guaranteed correct solution is to hire a team of surveyors to make sure the distances are exact and the sides perfectly parallel. But really, who would do that?

    When I first started to write programs, I was very bad at it - unsuprising, since this is the default status for any particular human with regard to any particular activity. Programming is somewhat unique, however, n that you can get good grades in your middle school/high school/undergraduate computer science classes, and grow a reputation as a Knowledgable Computer Person to whom others seek out for help during exam season, and *still* be quite bad at programming.

     Actually come to think of it, this may also apply to most other skills, but not as obviously.
