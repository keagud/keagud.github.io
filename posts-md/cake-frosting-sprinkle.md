# The Cake-Frosting-Sprinkle Development Model


<blockquote>
Imagine you want to plant a brand new vegetable garden somewhere in your yard, and the first task is to stake out the plot. Odds are good that you'll be perfectly successful by just eyeballing it, hammering a wooden stake at one corner, and using it as a reference. Or you could be more formal and use a tape measure. The ultimate, guaranteed correct solution is to hire a team of surveyors to make sure the distances are exact and the sides perfectly parallel. But really, who would do that?
